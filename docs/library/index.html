The default value is `A plain todo list` |\n|width |optional|the width of UI, default value is `100%`. All CSS units are valid to be used e.g `60%`, `400px`, `15em`, etc. A min-width as `320px` was set, means UI width can not be smaller than this.|\n|base |optional|a name space used for creating different todolist. It is actually used in naming the data tiddlers internally used for todo lists. The default value is `base`. |\n<<<\n\n!! Add, edit items\n<<<\n!!!

This is a keyboard shotcut and can be customized via [[Keyboard Shortcut Tab|$:/core/ui/ControlPanel/KeyboardShortcuts]]. Find `add-to-item` entry and add your shortcut key of choice. It is assumed `Enter` is set.\n\n!!! Edit an item\n# Click on the edit button <span class=\"kk-doc\">{{$:/core/images/edit-button}}</span>, this will enable inplace editing of all items\n# Goto the desired item and edit it\n# Finally click on done button <span class=\"kk-doc\">{{$:/core/images/done-button}}</span>\n<<<\n\n!!

Delete an item\n* To delete an item, go the desired row in todolist and click on <span class=\"kk-doc\">{{$:/core/images/delete-button}}</span> at the right side\n<<<\n\n!! Priority\n<<<\nTodolist supports task priorities. In RC 7 five colors are used e.g red, magenta, yellow, green, and blue for //very high//, //high//, //medium//, //low//, and //very low// priority. The circle with no colors means no priority!\n\n<$list filter=\"crimson magenta gold limegreen mediumblue none\" variable=\"color\"><$macrocall $name=disp-priority-badge color=<<color>> />\n</$list>\n\nWhen a new item is added to todo list, a grey circle appears right of the task row. No color means no priority. Clicking on this small icon, cycles through colors and you can choose the right color for priority this item has. These are similar to categories.\n<<<\n\n!! Categories\n<<<\nTodolist has several categories and support user categories.

How to use categories\nA category is a simple macro. To use a category use the related macro. Each category macro has a syntax like below:\n\n```\n<<mac-name text:\"your-text-here\">>\n```\n\nFor example to create an item with high priority add new item with the below description (text in textbox)\n\n```\n<<high \"This is a high priority item\">>\n```\nThe current version of Todolist has eight category macros: `high`, `normal`, `low`, `fixme`, `bug`, `tip`, `horn`, and `share`.\n<<<\n\n!!

Terminology\n<<<\n; Trashbin\n: i. a collection of data tiddlers holds the deleted tiddlers\n: ii. the name of plugin and the mechanism to delete tiddlers temporarily and restore them or delete them permanently later\n\n; Delete tiddler\n: the action to //move a tiddler to Trashbin//. This action removes tiddler from wiki, but it does not eliminate it permanently.\n\n; Deleted tiddler\n: a tiddler is removed from wiki and stored in Trashbin. This tiddler can be restored.\n\n; Delete permanently\n:the action to eliminate and destroy a tiddler such that it cannot be restored anymore. This action is performed on deleted tiddlers in Trashbin.\n<<<\n\n!! How to\n<<<\n* Every tiddler has a new button as <<doc-svg $:/plugins/kookma/trashbin/images/trash-alt>> and is called ''Move to Trashbin''\n\n* On clicking on ''Move to Trashbin'' the tiddler is deleted from wiki and moved to Trashbin (//it is not removed permanently//)\n\n* A sidebar tab called ''Trashbin'' shows what is existed in the Trashbin\n\n* In sidebar tab ''Trashbin'' there is //header// and a //list// of deleted tiddlers\n** Deleted tiddlers in Trashbin list are displayed in alphanumerical order.\n** Each tiddler in Trashbin list has a ''delete permanently'' button <<doc-svg $:/plugins/kookma/trashbin/images/times.svg>>  and a ''restore'' button <<doc-svg $:/plugins/kookma/trashbin/images/recycle>> individually and let you to remove or restore a single tiddler.\n** In the header, the <<doc-svg $:/plugins/kookma/trashbin/images/trash-alt>> lets you to remove all tiddlers from Trashbin and ''delete them permanently''.\n** In the header, the <<doc-svg $:/plugins/kookma/trashbin/images/recycle>> lets you to ''restore all'' tiddlers from Trashbin.\n\n* On clicking on every tiddler in Trashbin list it is opened in story river.\n\n* Every deleted tiddler opened in story river has colored borders, a restore button as <<doc-svg $:/plugins/kookma/trashbin/images/recycle>> which is called ''Restore''\n\n* On clicking on ''restore'' button <<doc-svg $:/plugins/kookma/trashbin/images/recycle>> the tiddler is restored.\n\n* It is possible to edit the deleted tiddler, for example change `title` or other fields (indexes) and restore a modified tiddler different from the original deleted one.\n<<<\n\n!! Impotent note\n<<<\nIf a tiddler is existed in Trashbin and another with the same title in TW:\n\n* when moving it to trash, a unique title is created by adding //numeric suffix//, so they never overwrite other tiddlers.\n\n* when restoring from Trashbin, a notification is appeared and notifies user and does not restore such tiddler. User needs to decide and rename the existing tiddler or modify the deleted tiddler title index in Trashbin before restoring.\n\n* Note that Trashbon title for deleting tiddlers (actually data tiddlers) does not change the real title of tiddlers which is stored in an index called `title`.\n<<<\n\n!! Install\n<<<\nSimply drag and drop $:/plugins/kookma/trashbin into your wiki, or download from [[source page|https://github.com/kookma/TW-Trashbin]]\n<<<\n\n!! Mechanism\n<<<\nTrash plugin has two parts\n\n* Move to Trashbin\n* Restore from Trashbin\n\n; By moving a tiddler to Trashbin it means\n\n# A new data tiddler created\n# The title of data tiddler is the title of objective tiddler prefixed with `$:/trashbin/`\n# All the fields of objective tiddler is moved into a new data tiddler\n# The objective tiddler is deleted\n\n\n; By restoring a tiddler from Trashbin, it means\n# A new tiddler is created\n# Its title is taken from the `title` index in data tiddler\n# All other index/value are copied to newly created tiddler fields respectively. This means every index creates a field\n# The data tiddler is deleted\n\n;Duplicates\n# Deleted tiddlers will get numeric suffix if another tiddler with same title is existed in Trashbin.\n# Tiddlers existed in wiki will never overwritten if a tiddler with the same title is tried to be restored. A notification will notify user and operation will be cancelled.\n# Note that, the real title of deleted tiddler is what stored in `title` index of data tiddler NOT the title of data tiddler itself which stores the deleted tiddler in Trashbin.\n<<<\n\n!!
